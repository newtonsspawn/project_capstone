# Capstone Project - Kaggle's Freesound Audio Tagging Competition

## Overview
Audio signal processing is a very complex field with many applications, ranging
from automated voice detection (Siri) to music recognition (Shazam). Freesound
has launched a competition, using the Kaggle platform, to build a model that can
train on both clean and noisy sound samples to be able to predict and classify
what new sounds it reads may be.

The challenge here will be figuring out how best to transform incoming audio
signals and how best to model on those transformations to best make these
predictions.
